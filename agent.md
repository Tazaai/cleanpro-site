## 🧭 Reading PROJECT_GUIDE.md context (Master Documentation)...
# 🧭 Clean Departure MVP + GitHub Copilot System – Project Guide
⚠️ SYSTEM CONTEXT FILE — **GitHub Copilot Managed**  
Used by **GitHub Copilot** to understand project goals, structure, and workflow for **MVP features, diagnostics, and deployment**.  
✅ MVP Features: Authentication, Admin Dashboard, Payments, Legal Compliance, Google Maps Integration

🔒 **EDIT PROTECTION**: This file should NOT be automatically modified. Changes require explicit developer authorization only.
🔐 GitHub Copilot Policy: This file is read-only by default.  
Any edits must follow the 2-step developer authorization process (manual confirmation in Codespaces + signed commit).

📋 **MANDATORY REVIEW PROCESS**: 
- **After each deployment**: GitHub Copilot MUST run `./review_report.sh` to validate system state
- **Before new tasks**: GitHub Copilot MUST review this PROJECT_GUIDE.md for current context
- **Post-task completion**: Update documentation and run comprehensive validation
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every deployment cycle requires full review and validation


**Last Updated**: October 26, 2025 - MVP COMPLETE with Full Authentication, Admin Dashboard, Payments & Maps ✅  
**Secret Management**: Enhanced with local vs CI/CD environment differentiation  
**Review Process**: Mandatory validation after each deployment and before new tasks
