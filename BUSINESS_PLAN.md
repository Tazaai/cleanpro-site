# ðŸ§¹ CleanPro Platform â€” Business Plan & Development Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Professional cleaning platform where clients can book services, see transparent pricing, and get dynamic discounts.  
**All business logic (pricing, discounts, distance, loyalty) is implemented in the backend for stability and easy management.**  
Frontend only handles booking forms and displaying price previews.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
1. **Booking System**
   - Collect client info: name, address, contact.
   - Service selection (residential, deep, office, move-in/out).
   - HQ address â†’ used for distance calculations.

2. **Dynamic Pricing**
   - Price per mÂ² (sqft auto-converted).
   - Free travel up to 40 miles.
   - Dynamic fee per mile after 40 miles.
   - Max distance cap (default 120 miles).
   - Price preview breakdown: base price, distance fee, discounts, total.

3. **Discounts**
   - First booking = standard price.
   - Weekly discount if rebook < 7 days.
   - Monthly discount if rebook < 30 days.
   - Loyalty discount (e.g., 2.5%).
   - Discounts only apply after first booking.

4. **Admin Control (via AppSheet + Firestore)**
   - Non-tech admin can edit:
     - `pricePerM2`
     - `weeklyDiscount`, `monthlyDiscount`, `loyaltyDiscount`
     - `distanceFee`
     - `freeMiles` (default 40)
     - `maxDistance` (default 120)
   - Config stored in Firestore (`config/pricing`).

5. **Transparency**
   - Clients always see a preview:
     - Base cleaning price
     - Distance fee
     - Discounts
     - Final total
