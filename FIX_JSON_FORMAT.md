# üîß Fixing GCP_SA_KEY JSON Format Issue

## Problem
The GCP_SA_KEY secret has invalid JSON format, causing deployment validation to fail.

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Go to GitHub Repository Settings
- Navigate to: https://github.com/Tazaai/cleanpro-site/settings/secrets/actions

### 2. Find GCP_SA_KEY Secret
- Look for the existing `GCP_SA_KEY` in the list
- Click the pencil icon to edit (or delete and recreate)

### 3. Ensure Proper JSON Format
The service account key should look exactly like this (no extra spaces/newlines):

```json
{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"key-id","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"client-id","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/..."}
```

### 4. Common Issues to Avoid
- ‚ùå Don't add extra spaces before/after the JSON
- ‚ùå Don't add newlines or line breaks
- ‚ùå Don't wrap in additional quotes
- ‚ùå Don't truncate the content
- ‚úÖ Copy the ENTIRE JSON content from the downloaded file

### 5. Test the JSON Locally (Optional)
Before adding to GitHub, you can test if your JSON is valid:

```bash
# Test your JSON file locally
cat your-service-account-key.json | jq .
# Should output the formatted JSON without errors
```

### 6. Update Secret in GitHub
- Paste the corrected JSON into the secret value field
- Save the secret
- Trigger a new deployment

## üöÄ After Fixing
The deployment should proceed with:
- ‚úÖ Valid JSON format detected
- ‚úÖ Proper Firebase authentication
- ‚úÖ Working coordination points API
- ‚úÖ Full system functionality

## üí° Pro Tip
When downloading the service account key from Google Cloud Console, use the downloaded file content directly - don't manually edit or reformat it.
